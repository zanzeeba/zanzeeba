quantum gravity and time
- 👀 in it i am trying to get to grips with Haskell and, quantum cryptography, and, quantum computing
- 👀 in the past i was a programmer in Cobol, Pascal, VB, PHP, Python and Golang (in sort of that progression) but i am currently working as an SRE with a mix of 
dev-ops (we are a small team) and we are an AWS house so it's CloudFormation etc. with Ansible, Packer and maybe Terraform and then New Relic, PagerDuty and a shed load of internal
and external API's
